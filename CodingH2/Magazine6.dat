Julia Hall Bowman Robinson (December 8, 1919 – July 30, 1985) was an American mathematician best known for her work
on decision problems and Hilbert's tenth problem.

Hilbert's tenth problem asks for an algorithm to determine whether a Diophantine equation has any solutions in
integers. A series of results developed in the 1940s through 1970 by Robinson, Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and
Yuri Matiyasevich resolved this problem in the negative; that is, they showed that no such algorithm can exist.
George Csicsery produced and directed a one-hour documentary about Robinson titled Julia Robinson and Hilbert's
Tenth Problem, that premiered at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Diego on January 7, 2008. Notices of the
American Mathematical Society printed a film review and an interview with the director. College Mathematics Journal
also published a film review.
