Possession acquired by consent
Most property possessed is obtained with the consent of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased,
received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The transfer of possession of goods is called delivery. For land, it is
common to speak of granting or giving possession. A temporary transfer of possession is called a bailment.
Bailment is often regarded as the separation of ownership and possession. For example, the library continues to
own the book while you possess it and will have the right to possess it again when your right comes to an end.
A common transaction involving bailment is a conditional sale or hire-purchase, in which the seller lets the
buyer have possession of the thing before it is paid for. The buyer pays the purchase price in installments and,
when it is fully paid, ownership of the thing is transferred from seller to buyer.

Possession acquired without consent
It is possible to obtain possession of a thing without anyone else's consent. First, you might take possession of
something which has never been possessed before. This can occur when you catch a wild animal; or create a new
thing, such as a loaf of bread. Secondly, you might find something which someone else has lost. Thirdly, you
might take something from another person without their consent. Possession acquired without consent is a property
right which the law protects. It gives rise to a right of possession which is enforceable against everyone except
those with a better right to possession.
