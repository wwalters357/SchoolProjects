While anyone can edit articles, to keep things manageable, only administrators can delete them. Note that removing
all text from a page does not delete it, it just leaves a blank page, which is discouraged as it is confusing to
readers. The text can be restored from the page history.

This page explains how to ask for an article to be deleted from Wikipedia. For all the gritty details, see the
deletion policy. Bear the following things in mind:

It is better to improve an article than to delete it for not being good enough.

An article that looks inappropriate may simply have been tampered with; you can fix this by reverting it to the
better, previous version.

If the article duplicates another, you can redirect it to the other one; there's no need for it to be deleted first.

It's polite to let the article's author know that you are asking for it to be deleted; you can find them in
the page history.

Pages you created yourself
If you create a page yourself and then change your mind, just add the text to the top of it; it will be deleted
shortly afterward. If other contributors have edited the page, however, this usually won't be done; use one of the
methods explained below.

Pages which are not articles
Not all pages in Wikipedia are encyclopedia articles. Those that begin with a prefix such as "Wikipedia:" or
"User:" are used for organizing the project, so are not considered part of the encyclopedia. Different rules apply
to these pages; you can't use the "proposed deletion" option mentioned below, and deletion discussions take place
in different places. If you think one of these pages should be deleted, see the full Guide to deletion, which has
more detailed instructions on what to do.

Speedy deletion
In certain limited circumstances, an article can be deleted on sight with no further discussion. These limited
circumstances are called the criteria for speedy deletion, and pages that meet them are usually removed quickly.
If you find one, you can mark it for deletion by adding the text {{delete| reason }} to the top of the page,
replacing "reason" with the reason it should be deleted. Most articles do not meet the criteria, however, so
check carefully before doing this.
