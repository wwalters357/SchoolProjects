There are two slightly different meanings of safety. For example, home safety may indicate a building's ability 
to protect against external harm events (such as weather, home invasion, etc.), or may indicate that its internal
installations (such as appliances, stairs, etc.) are safe (not dangerous or harmful) for its inhabitants.

Discussions of safety often include mention of related terms. Security is such a term. With time the definitions
between these two have often become interchanged, equated, and frequently appear juxtaposed in the same sentence.
Readers unfortunately are left to conclude whether they comprise a redundancy. This confuses the uniqueness that
should be reserved for each by itself. When seen as unique, as we intend here, each term will assume its rightful
place in influencing and being influenced by the other.

Safety is the condition of a “steady state” of an organization or place doing what it is supposed to do.
“What it is supposed to do” is defined in terms of public codes and standards, associated architectural and
engineering designs, corporate vision and mission statements, and operational plans and personnel policies.
For any organization, place, or function, large or small, safety is a normative concept. It complies with
situation-specific definitions of what is expected and acceptable.

Using this definition, protection from a home’s external threats and protection from its internal structural
and equipment failures (see Meanings, above) are not two types of safety but rather two aspects of a home’s
steady state. In the world of everyday affairs, not all goes as planned. Some entity’s steady state is challenged.
This is where security science, which is of more recent date, enters. Drawing from the definition of safety, then:
Security is the process or means, physical or human, of delaying, preventing, and otherwise protecting against
external or internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and other individuals or actions that threaten, hinder or destroy an organization’s “steady state,” and deprive it of its intended purpose for being.
Using this generic definition of safety it is possible to specify the elements of a security program.

Limitations
Safety can be limited in relation to some guarantee or a standard of insurance to the quality and unharmful
function of an object or organization. It is used in order to ensure that the object or organization will do
only what it is meant to do. It is important to realize that safety is relative. Eliminating all risk, if even
possible, would be extremely difficult and very expensive. A safe situation is one where risks of injury or
property damage are low and manageable.
