The base currency of the United States is the U.S. dollar. Since 1946 it has been printed in seven denominations:
$1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Previously there have also been five larger denominations: $500, $1,000, $5,000,
and $10,000 were printed for general use (in large transactions), and a $100,000 bill for certain internal
transactions.

Overview and history
Large-denomination currency (i.e., banknotes with a negotiable face value of $500 or higher) had been used in 
the United States since the late 18th century. The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina,
authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780. Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500
and $1,000 notes on October 16, 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7, 1781. High-denomination treasury notes were issued,
for example during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812). During the American
Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes. During the Federal banknote issuing period
(1861 to present), the earliest high-denomination notes included three-year Interest-bearing notes of $500,
$1,000, and $5,000, authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861.[8] In total, 11 different types of U.S. currency
were issued in high-denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates. The obverse of United States
banknotes generally depict either historical figures, allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts
(e.g., liberty, justice), or a combination of both. The reverse designs range from abstract scroll-work with
ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works.

Public versus institutional use
Series 1934 Gold certificates ($100, $1,000, $10,000 and $100,000) were issued after the gold standard was
repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9, 1933
(see United States Executive Order 6102). Thus the Series 1934 notes were used only for intra-government
(i.e., Federal Reserve Bank) transactions and were not issued to the public. This series was discontinued in
1940. The Series 1928 Gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green. See History of the United States
dollar.

Passive retirement
Although they are still technically legal tender in the United States, high-denomination bills were last
printed on December 27, 1945, and officially discontinued on July 14, 1969, by the Federal Reserve System,
supposedly due to 'lack of use'. The $5,000 and $10,000 effectively disappeared well before then.
The Federal Reserve began taking high-denomination currency out of circulation (destroying large bills received
by banks) in 1969. As of May 30, 2009, only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist; 342 remaining $5,000 bills;
and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills. Due to their rarity, collectors often pay considerably more than the face value
of the bills to acquire them. Some are in museums in other parts of the world.
