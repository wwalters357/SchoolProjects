Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, "tweets,"
restricted to 140 characters. Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them.
Users access Twitter through its website interface, SMS or a mobile device app. Twitter Inc. is based in
San Francisco, California, United States, and has more than 25 offices around the world.

Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams and launched in July,
whereby the service rapidly gained worldwide popularity. In 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million
tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the
ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". As of 2016, Twitter had more than
319 million monthly active users. On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the
largest source of breaking news, with 40 million tweets sent by 10 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day.

Verified accounts
The official Twitter profile of Twitter, Inc. The blue check mark right of the profile name confirms that it is
a verified account. A verified Twitter Account formally validates the identity of the person or company that
owns the account—the aim of the "verified" status is to prove that a real-world person or company is not being
impersonated, through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top-right corner of a user's page, or next to
the username in the platform's Search function. Twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark, and it is
frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics, music, movies, business, fashion, government,
sports, media, and journalism.

The owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard
Twitter-account holders. These features include:
The ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented. Since verified accounts typically
receive a lot of followers, account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from
verified accounts.
The ability to view information about their followers and their involvement on Twitter.
The ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers.

On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide
information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users and
said in a statement, "... it's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for
their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so."
